# Golf

To run the game download the [latest release](https://github.com/anton2026gamca/Golf/releases).

This project was made using my library for raylib, go check it out [here](https://github.com/anton2026gamca/BetterRaylib).

### Golf Level Editor (Raylib required)

To run the level editor you will need the [golf-levelbuilder.exe](https://github.com/anton2026gamca/Golf/blob/main/golf-levelbuilder/golf-levelbuilder.exe) file and the [resources](https://github.com/anton2026gamca/Golf/tree/main/golf-levelbuilder/resources) folder.<br>
The level editor loads/saves the level from/to the [level.dat](https://github.com/anton2026gamca/Golf/blob/main/golf-levelbuilder/level.dat) file.<br>
To load the level in game:<br>
 #### 1. save it<br>
 #### 2. copy it to the resources folder of the game ![Screenshot 2025-01-05 204550](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3dff3a7-ce17-4891-a642-4dacaff4188b)<br>
 #### 4. rename it to l[level number].dat (replace "[level number]" with the level number you want it to be)<br>
 #### 5. edit the levels_hash array in the main.cpp and recompile
