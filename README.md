# Golf

To run the game you need the [golf.exe](https://github.com/anton2026gamca/Golf/blob/main/golf/golf.exe) file with the [resources](https://github.com/anton2026gamca/Golf/tree/main/golf/resources) folder

### Golf Level Builder

To run the level editor you will need the [golf-levelbuilder.exe](https://github.com/anton2026gamca/Golf/blob/main/golf-levelbuilder/golf-levelbuilder.exe) file and the [resources](https://github.com/anton2026gamca/Golf/tree/main/golf-levelbuilder/resources) folder

The level editor loads/saves the level to the [level.dat](https://github.com/anton2026gamca/Golf/blob/main/golf-levelbuilder/level.dat) file

To load the level in game:<br>
    1. save it<br>
    2. copy it to the resources folder of the game<br>
    3. rename it to l[level number].dat (replace "[level number]" with the level number you want it to be)<br>
    4. edit the levels_hash array in the main.cpp and recompile
